After going to the linked KBase site, scroll down to the section called Ammonia Oxidation. Click on ""Nitrososphaeraceae.genome"" that is listed as the KBase Object Name. From there, go to ""Related Data"" tab, and then click ""NitrososphaeraceaeEdit.model"", which provides the reactions, compounds, genes, etc that will go into the final model. However, from there (or anywhere else) I cannot find the actual model. When I try to download the genome that is listed on the overview tab (using wget https://narrative.kbase.us/#dataview/71260/26/6), it only downloads some kind of html. Also, I didn't find anywhere in the manuscript that descibes a complete metabolic model (though they do describe models that were manipulated/used in some other way). 

EDIT: Found the models!! On the side pannel (you may need to click on the blue expansion arrow in order to see it), expand ""DATA"", and scroll until you find ""NitrososphaeraceaeEdit.model"". When you expand it using the three small buttons on the side, there are several little gray icons. Click on the download icon, and choose ""SBML"" to download. Manually upload into the created SCC folder and renamed as nitrososphaeraceae_original (I called this folder ""TA21"")","The model did not pass validation at first. There were 9 errors [all the same: (SBML Validation Rule #fbc-20303) The value of attribute 'fbc:chemicalFormula' on the SBML <species> object must be set to a string consisting only of atomic names or user defined compounds and their occurrence. Reference: L3V1 Fbc V3 Section 3.4 Encountered 'n' when expecting a capital letter.The chemicalFormula 'null' has incorrect syntax.] It seems like if null changes to Null, it might pass. 

The lines that were causing an error were: id=M_cpd17042_c0; M_cpd17041_c0; M_cpd22290_c0; M_cpd28297_c0; M_cpd19168_c0; M_cpd30750_c0; M_cpd12713_c0; M_cpd17043_c0; M_cpd11416_c0. After these lines were adjusted as described, they no longer show as errors. However, the following error did show up next in the validator: ""Error Line 25604 Column 93: (SBML Validation Rule #21101) A <reaction> definition must contain at least one <speciesReference>, either in its <listOfReactants> or its <listOfProducts>.

So I deleted that reaction (also included in the deleted lines file), but when I re-ran in metanet, the same error popped up for the sequentially next reaction (rxn13783_c0).

Lactate dehydrogenase and related enzymes involving cytochrome c had many duplicated reactions and incorrect compartment assignments. Cytochrome c oxidase, peroxidase, reductase, NADH:ubiquinone reductase and other mitochondrial electron transport chain reactions were curated. R. toruloides is known to have coenzyme Q9 (ubiquinone-9) with nine isoprenyl units (Yamada and Kondo, 1973), and our lipidomics analysis also detected coenzyme Q9. The ubiquinone synthesis reactions from other existing models were modified to include 9 isoprenyl units. Heme biosynthesis reactions were also manually curated since heme O and heme A synthesis reactions in BiGG database had incorrect stoichiometries.  There were many incorrect reactions involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and beta-oxidation, especially for unsaturated fatty acids. Impossible lumped reactions were removed considering the cis and trans configuration of fatty acids, and irrelevant fatty acid reactions (bacteria or plant specific unsaturated fatty acids) were removed. Long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid desaturase reactions were moved from cytosol to endoplasmic reticulum, and short-chain peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation reactions were moved to mitochondria since R. toruloides possesses both mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes. Sphingolipid metabolism was extended to include sphingolipid desaturase, methyltransferase, and fungal ceramide biosynthesis and the reactions were placed in endoplasmic reticulum. Localization of reactions involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and remodeling, and triacylglycerol were also updated.",,,,,
