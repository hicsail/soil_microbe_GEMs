# About

This repository contains a draft Shiny application to visualize the results of mapping 1400 soil samples to a custom genome database of over 30,000 soil genomes. Many genomes have genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) that can be used for phenotype simulation. Certain GEMs have been converted to COMETS format for future integration with the SmartCOMETs interface.

Only a subset of the database can be visualized due to file size limits, but a more sophisticated application is in development. (partnership with BU SAIL). Please reach out to zoeywerbin@gmail.com for project updates.

The repository to generate the database and map abundances of samples is located [here](https://github.com/zoey-rw/soil_genome_db)
