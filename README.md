# soil_microbe_GEMs
Compilation of published genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for constraint-based modeling of the soil microbiome

Each organism has its own directory. GEMs are uploaded in various formats depending on the original publication (usually XML/SBML). An R script was used to enforce a common nomenclature for all exchange metabolites (`01_modify_metabolites.r`). Python was used to verify COBRA compliance and ensure that growth rates match the rates described in publications. (`/02_make_cobra_compliant.ipynb`). 

Each GEMs have been evaluated for growth on various carbon substrates (`evaluate_carbon_usage.ipynb`) 

Simulation-ready GEMs can be integrated into community modeling frameworks of various flavors:<br>
